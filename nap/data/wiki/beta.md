# *what happens in betas, stays in betas*

The [beta release](http://beta.freecodecamp.com) is where we ask people to test out new features.

# Your progress there will NOT be saved to the production site!!! #
Think of it as just a preview test, to check things work properly. In fact the database maybe reset at any time so we can try out things like the sign-up process.

We really appreciate everyone's help ironing out the Beta Release, but please understand it's not possible to merge two user databases with completely different sets of content. We're moving fast to bring you new material ASAP!
