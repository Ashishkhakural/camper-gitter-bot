## Roadmap
We're looking for ideas for new features to add, and some people to help working on the bot.
Have a look at Tickets with [help wanted](https://github.com/dcsan/gitterbot/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22help+wanted%22) on the repo and maybe you can contribute?

In future, we're planning:
- Bonfire step-by-step tutorials will be available via chat and from the camperbot
- realtime tagging and searching of chats by topic
- a scripting language and natural language processing
Get involved and let us know what you'd like to see next!

## Developer chatroom
- https://gitter.im/dcsan/gitterbot
Join us on the repo chatroom to discuss new features. Perhaps we can pair up to work on the bot 2.0!

For messing around with the bot and trying commands out, proofreading your edits to wiki content etc.
