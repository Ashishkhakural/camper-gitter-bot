Hi this is **[CamperBot](https://github.com/FreeCodeCamp/freecodecamp/wiki/camperbot)**! I can assist you in this chatroom :smile: 

- ``find TOPIC``  find all entries about topic. ex: `find js`
- `wiki TOPIC` show contents of topic page
- `thanks @username`  send points to another user when they help you!
- `about @username`   shows info on that user

:unlock: see the [wiki](https://github.com/FreeCodeCamp/freecodecamp/wiki/camperbot) for more commands!

## more commands
