The bot responds to a few commands

#### **`help $topic`**  
find related materials to that topic, usually a page from the [wiki](https://github.com/bothelpers/kbase/wiki/)  
examples: `help css` `help bootstrap`

#### `topics`
show the list of topics.

#### `find $topic` 
this will search for entries that include `$topic` in the title. We'll add fulltext search in future.  
examples: `find wiki`

#### `about @username`
show info about another user.

#### `thanks @username #tag`
This will give another user some karma points! Reward users who give you some help inside the chats.
If you add the `#tag` we'll archive the chat so others can search for it later with that tag.
