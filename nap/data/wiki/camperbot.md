Hi this is CamperBot! I can assist you in this chatroom :smile: 

- `find TOPIC` show a list of entries about topic.  
ex: `find js` 
- `wiki TOPIC` show wiki contents on that topic.  
ex: `wiki js ternary`
- `thanks @username` - send points to another user when they help you!
- `about @username` shows info on that user

see the [wiki](https://github.com/FreeCodeCamp/freecodecamp/wiki/camperbot) for more!

## more commands
- `topics` selected pages from the wiki
- `rooms` shows the list of topical rooms the bot is in. Try to join a room relevant to what you're talking about!
