Hay All! We're working on a new CamperBot for FreeCodeCamp. 
This will make the chat rooms more fun and useful. 
We're launching soon, but it would be great if people could test it out a bit and let me know if you have any problems.
This will pull in hints for the bonfires and Wiki content into the chat room.
