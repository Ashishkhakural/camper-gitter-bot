###"Wiki" is a Hawaiian word meaning "quick" and that is a good mindset to have when creating a Wiki.

Wiki's need to be concisely written on a granular level and should cover around a quarter to a third of a page if you were to think about it's size in a length on your screen. If the Wiki is longer than that consider breaking it into seperate smaller Wikis that are linked to each other if the content will permit it.

You can include an image(s) if it enhances the presentation quality of the Wiki, replaces and reduces text and helps improve the clarity, content and copy of the Wiki. Also, do not use a question format when phrasing the title as they do not always work well in regards to search functionality.

In a typical Wiki, text is written using a markup language. The built in editor on GitHub has clear instructions on using it to write and style different elements, add links, images and create lists.

We are always happy to help new contributors get involved in writing, editing, localizing, and coding on Free Code Camp, and we encourage everyone to participate in helping to make Free Code Camp the best it can be. If you have questions about contributing to the Free Code Camp Wiki message [@danraley](https://gitter.im/danraley) in Gitter.

We look forward to wiki-ing with you!
