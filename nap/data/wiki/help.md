# Help with the bot

The bot responds to a few commands. 

#### `help $topic`
I'll try and find related materials to that topic, usually a page from the [wiki](https://github.com/bothelpers/kbase/wiki/)

#### `thanks @username #tag`
This will give another user some karma points! Reward users who give you some help inside the chats.
If you add the `#tag` we'll archive the chat so others can search for it later with that tag.
