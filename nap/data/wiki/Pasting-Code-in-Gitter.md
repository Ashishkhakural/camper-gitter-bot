Using Gitter's markdown syntax will make your code more readable for your fellow campers.  

Use three ticks [ ` ] -- Keyboard help [here](https://github.com/freecodecamp/freecodecamp/wiki/code-formatting) -- Gitter will usually fill in the closing ticks for you, but if they aren't there remember to end your code with a line of three ticks.  **Ticks must always be on their own lines.** When you are ready to send your message press [Ctrl]+[Enter].

\`\`\`     
var some = 'code';     
\`\`\`

You can edit your previously sent messages by hovering over the message and clicking the **...**, 
so if you accidentally paste unformatted code, just fix it.  

If your code is long, you can create a [Gist](https://gist.github.com/) and paste the link in Gitter. This also allows fellow campers to collaborate with you more directly.
