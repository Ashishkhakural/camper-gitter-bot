##Welcome to the Free Code Camp Wiki!

Our open source community's Wiki focuses on answering your questions about learning to code and getting a coding job. We also cover in detail our:

-   curriculum
-   local Campsite communities    
-   nonprofit projects    

"Wiki" is a Hawaiian word meaning "quick", and that is a good mindset to have when creating a Wiki. Please reference our [Wiki style guide] (https://github.com/FreeCodeCamp/freecodecamp/wiki/Wiki-Style-Guide) for more direction regarding styling.

For contributing to any of the bonfires, please use this [template.](https://github.com/FreeCodeCamp/FreeCodeCamp/wiki/Bonfire-Wiki-Template)
