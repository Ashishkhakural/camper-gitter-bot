##Welcome to the Free Code Camp Wiki!

###Our wiki is a web application that allows collaborative creation, modification, extension, and deletion of its content and structure.

As an Open Source community we want to maintain a Wiki that addresses and answers questions relating to JavaScript or programming in general. The following types of content are appropriate for the Free Code Camp Wiki:

1)   Content that is related to our curriculum and learning programming concepts.  
2)   Content that is related to our local Campsite communities.  
3)   Content that is related to our nonprofit projects.    
4)   Content that supports Free Code Camp's mission or community.  

Content which appears to be unrelated to Free Code Camp and not falling into any of the above categories may be deleted as spam without notice.

"Wiki" is a Hawaiian word meaning "quick" and that is a good mindset to have when creating a Wiki. Please reference our [Wiki style guide] (https://github.com/FreeCodeCamp/freecodecamp/wiki/Wiki-Style-Guide) for more direction regarding styling.
