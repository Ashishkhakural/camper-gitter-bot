##Welcome to the Free Code Camp Wiki!

Our open source community's Wiki focuses on answering questions about learning to code and getting a coding job. All wiki articles should be about our:

-   curriculum and learning to code in general    
-   local Campsite communities    
-   nonprofit projects    
-   mission and community    

We may delete content that doesn't fall into any of these categories.

"Wiki" is a Hawaiian word meaning "quick", and that is a good mindset to have when creating a Wiki. Please reference our [Wiki style guide] (https://github.com/FreeCodeCamp/freecodecamp/wiki/Wiki-Style-Guide) for more direction regarding styling.
 
If you have questions about contributing to the Free Code Camp Wiki message [@danraley](https://gitter.im/danraley) in Gitter.

We look forward to collaborating with you on expanding and improving this wiki!
