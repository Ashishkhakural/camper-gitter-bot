        - "Please note that the video for this challenge is a little outdated, and doesn't perfectly match these steps. We plan to record a new video soon."
        - "OK, we're finally ready to start pair programming!"
        - "Pair Programming is where two people code together on the same computer. It is an efficient way to collaborate, and widely practiced at software companies. Pair Programming is one of the core concepts of \"Agile\" Software Development, which you will hear more about later."
        - "Many people use Skype or Google Hangouts to pair program, but if you talk with professional software engineers, they will tell you that it's not really pair programming unless both people have the ability to use the keyboard and mouse."
        - "The most popular tool for pair programming is Screenhero. You can download Screenhero for <a href='http://links.screenhero.com/e/c/eyJlbWFpbF9pZCI6Ik1qQTNNem9XQkNJQ1pBQUNjd0FYQVZrVEdnRkxNamtfX0JWZEdGVEpSZkVCWlRwbFpXRTBNamM0WVMxaE56SmlMVEV4WlRRdE9HUXpZUzFpWXpVNE1HRTJNalkxTldNNk1UUTJNVEEyQUE9PSIsInBvc2l0aW9uIjowLCJocmVmIjoiaHR0cDovL2RsLnNjcmVlbmhlcm8uY29tL3NtYXJ0ZG93bmxvYWQvZklYQU1UUUJBTEtQQkhQTC9TY3JlZW5oZXJvLnppcD9zb3VyY2U9d2ViIn0=' target='_blank'>Mac</a> or <a href='http://links.screenhero.com/e/c/eyJlbWFpbF9pZCI6Ik1qQTNNem9XQkNJQ1pBQUNjd0FYQVZrVEdnRkxNamtfX0JWZEdGVEpSZkVCWlRwbFpXRTBNamM0WVMxaE56SmlMVEV4WlRRdE9HUXpZUzFpWXpVNE1HRTJNalkxTldNNk1UUTJNVEEyQUE9PSIsInBvc2l0aW9uIjoxLCJocmVmIjoiaHR0cDovL2RsLnNjcmVlbmhlcm8uY29tL3NtYXJ0ZG93bmxvYWQvZklYQU1UUUJBTEtQQkhQTC9TY3JlZW5oZXJvLXNldHVwLmV4ZSJ9' target='_blank'>Windows</a>. Create your new user account from within the app."
        - "We have a special chat room for people ready to pair program. Go to our <a href='//gitter.im/FreeCodeCamp/LetsPair' target='_blank'>LetsPair chatroom on Gitter</a> and type \"Hello Pair Programmers!\""
        - "If someone is available, they will be your \"pair\" - the person you pair programming with."
        - "If no one gets back to you in the first few minutes, don't worry. There will be lots of opportunities to pair program in the future."
        - "If someone does get back to you, private message them and ask for the email address they used to register Screenhero."
        - "Add them as a new contact in Screenhero, then click the monitor-looking button to attempt to share your screen with them."
        - "Once the Screenhero session starts, your screen's margins will glow orange. You are now sharing your screen."
        - "Your pair will have their own cursor, and will be able to type text on his or her keyboard."
        - "Now it's time to tackle our Bonfires. You can begin them by advancing to the next challenge."
        - "Once you you finish pair programming, end the session in Screenhero session."
        - "Congratulations! You have completed your first pair programming session."
        - "Pair program as much as possible with different campers until you've completed all the Bonfire challenges. This is a big time investment, but the JavaScript practice you get will be well worth it!"
        - "Mark this Waypoint complete and move on."
